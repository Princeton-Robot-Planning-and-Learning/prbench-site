### Description
A 3D motion planning environment where the goal is to reach a target sphere with the robot's end effector.

The robot is a Kinova Gen-3 with 7 degrees of freedom. The target is a sphere with radius 0.100m positioned randomly within the workspace bounds.

The workspace bounds are:
- X: [0.0, 0.5]
- Y: [0.1, 0.8]
- Z: [0.0, 0.5]

Only targets that are reachable via inverse kinematics are sampled.

### Observation Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following object features:
| **Index** | **Object** | **Feature** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | robot | joint_1 |
| 1 | robot | joint_2 |
| 2 | robot | joint_3 |
| 3 | robot | joint_4 |
| 4 | robot | joint_5 |
| 5 | robot | joint_6 |
| 6 | robot | joint_7 |
| 7 | robot | finger_state |
| 8 | robot | grasp_active |
| 9 | robot | grasp_tf_x |
| 10 | robot | grasp_tf_y |
| 11 | robot | grasp_tf_z |
| 12 | robot | grasp_tf_qx |
| 13 | robot | grasp_tf_qy |
| 14 | robot | grasp_tf_qz |
| 15 | robot | grasp_tf_qw |
| 16 | target | x |
| 17 | target | y |
| 18 | target | z |


### Action Space
An action space for a 7 DOF robot that can open and close its gripper.

    Actions are bounded relative joint positions and open / close.

    The open / close logic is: <-0.5 is close, >0.5 is open, and otherwise no change.


### Rewards
The reward structure is simple:
- **-1.0** penalty at every timestep until the goal is reached
- **Termination** occurs when the end effector is within 0.100m of the target center

This encourages the robot to reach the target as quickly as possible while avoiding infinite episodes.

This is a very common kind of environment.
