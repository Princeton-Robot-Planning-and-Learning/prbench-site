### Environment Group Description
A 2D physics-based tool-use environment where a robot must use an L-shaped hook to scoop small objects from the left side of a middle wall and pour them onto the right side. The middle wall is half the height of the world, allowing objects to be scooped over it. **Environment Setup**: - **Middle Wall**: A wall at the center of the world that extends from the floor to half the world height - **Small Objects**: 5 circles and 5 squares initially on the left side - **L-shaped Hook**: A tool that can be grasped and manipulated by the robot - **Four Boundary Walls**: Enclose the entire workspace The robot has a movable circular base and an extendable arm with gripper fingers. The hook is a kinematic object that can be grasped and used as a tool to scoop the small objects. Small objects are dynamic and follow realistic PyMunk physics, but they cannot be grasped directly by the robot. **Observation Space**: The observation is a fixed-size vector containing the state of all objects: - **Robot**: position (x,y), orientation (θ), velocities (vx,vy,ω), arm extension, gripper gap - **Hook**: position, orientation, dimensions (L-shaped tool, can be grasped) - **Small Circles** (5): position, radius, velocities (dynamic, non-graspable) - **Small Squares** (5): position, size, orientation, velocities (dynamic, non-graspable) All objects include physics properties like mass, moment of inertia, and color information for rendering.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.030 | 0.030 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.030 | 0.030 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.098 | 0.098 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.080 | 0.080 |
| 4 | dgripper | Change in gripper gap (positive is open) | -0.015 | 0.015 |


### Rewards
A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when at least 70% of the small objects have been moved to the right side of the middle wall.

**Termination Condition**: The episode terminates when the fraction of small objects with x-position greater than the middle wall's x-position exceeds the success threshold (0.7).

**Goal Achievement Strategy**: The robot must:
1. Grasp the L-shaped hook tool with its gripper
2. Position the hook to scoop small objects on the left side
3. Lift and move the hook (with objects) over the half-height middle wall
4. Pour the objects onto the right side
5. Repeat until enough objects are transferred

**Physics Integration**: Since this environment uses PyMunk physics simulation, objects have realistic dynamics including:
- Friction between surfaces
- Collision response and momentum transfer
- Realistic grasping and tool manipulation dynamics
- Indirect manipulation through tool-object interactions
- NOTE: No gravity is applied, but damping simulates frictional losses
- Small objects use NON_GRASPABLE_COLLISION_TYPE to prevent direct grasping


### References
This environment implements a complex tool-use manipulation task with physics-based dynamics. It extends the concept of tool use to include scooping and pouring behaviors, requiring spatial reasoning about container-like tools.

**Key Features**:
- **Tool-Use Paradigm**: Robot must grasp and manipulate an L-shaped hook to indirectly move small objects
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Objects must be scooped over a half-height wall dividing the workspace
- **Non-Graspable Objects**: Small objects cannot be directly grasped, requiring tool-mediated manipulation
- **Multi-Object Manipulation**: Handle many small objects simultaneously through containment
- **PyMunk Physics Engine**: Provides realistic 2D rigid body dynamics for tool-object interactions
- **Collision Type System**: Uses NON_GRASPABLE_COLLISION_TYPE to prevent direct grasping of small objects

**Research Applications**:
- Tool-use learning and reasoning
- Container-based manipulation strategies
- Multi-step planning with tool grasping and scooping
- Physics-aware motion planning for pouring behaviors
- Evaluation of indirect manipulation vs. direct grasping
- Long-horizon task planning (repeated scoop-pour cycles)

This environment enables evaluation of manipulation policies that require understanding of containment, tool use, and multi-object manipulation under realistic physics constraints. It tests the ability to reason about which objects can be manipulated directly vs. indirectly.
