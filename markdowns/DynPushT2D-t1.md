### Environment Group Description
A 2D physics-based environment where the goal is to push a T-shaped block to match a goal pose using a simple dot robot (kinematic circle) with PyMunk physics simulation.

## Variant Description
There is just one T shape and one goal.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Delta x position for robot (positive is right) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 1 | dy | Delta y position for robot (positive is up) | -0.050 | 0.050 |

### Rewards
The reward is based on the coverage of the T-block with respect to the goal pose, computed using Shapely geometric intersection.
