### Description
A 2D environment where the goal is to touch all buttons, possibly by using a stick for buttons that are out of the robot's direct reach.

In this environment, there are always 10 buttons.

The robot has a movable circular base and a retractable arm with a rectangular vacuum end effector.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.196 | 0.196 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.100 | 0.100 |
| 4 | vac | Directly sets the vacuum (0.0 is off, 1.0 is on) | 0.000 | 1.000 |


### Rewards
A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when all buttons have been pressed.


### References
This environment is based on the Stick Button environment that was originally introduced in "Learning Neuro-Symbolic Skills for Bilevel Planning" (Silver et al., CoRL 2022). This version is simplified in that the robot or stick need only make contact with a button to press it, rather than explicitly pressing. Also, the full stick works for pressing, not just the tip.
