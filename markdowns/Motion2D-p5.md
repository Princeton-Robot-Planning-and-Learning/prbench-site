### Environment Group Description
A 2D environment where the goal is to reach a target region while avoiding static obstacles. The robot has a movable circular base and a retractable arm with a rectangular vacuum end effector. The arm and vacuum do not need to be used in this environment.

### Variant Description
There are always 5 narrow passages.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.196 | 0.196 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.100 | 0.100 |
| 4 | vac | Directly sets the vacuum (0.0 is off, 1.0 is on) | 0.000 | 1.000 |


### Rewards
A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when the robot's position is within the target region.

Narrow passages are a classic challenge in motion planning.
