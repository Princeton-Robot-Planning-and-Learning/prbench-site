### Environment Group Description
A 2D physics-based tool-use environment where a robot must use an L-shaped hook to scoop small objects from the left side of a middle wall and pour them onto the right side. The middle wall is half the height of the world, allowing objects to be scooped over it.

### Variant Description
This variant has 20 scoopable objects.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.030 | 0.030 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.030 | 0.030 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.098 | 0.098 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.080 | 0.080 |
| 4 | dgripper | Change in gripper gap (positive is open) | -0.015 | 0.015 |


### Rewards
A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when at least 70% of the small objects have been moved to the right side of the middle wall.
